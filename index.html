  <h1>VRBB L8 Maximizer</h1>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 20px; max-width: 700px; line-height: 1.5;">
  <p>
    When there is no double deploy bonus, starting from a neutral or enemy portal, 3 agents from the same faction can only build an <b>opposing-faction L8 portal</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    With 4 same-faction agents (or 2 during a double deploy event), starting from a neutral or enemy portal, the <b>only</b> way to achieve a same-faction L8 portal after one VRBB phase is to <b>deploy the VRBB on a neutral or enemy portal</b> and consume <b>one flip card</b> in the process.
  </p>
  <p>
    With 5–7 same-faction agents (or 3 during a double deploy event), starting from a neutral or enemy portal, it is possible to achieve an L8 portal <b>without using a flip card</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, starting from a <b>neutral portal</b> always gives you valid options. You only need to set the portal's team manually during initialization if you're trying to preserve L8 deployments from non-present agents.
